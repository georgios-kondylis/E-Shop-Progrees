1. inline-block. Shrinks to Fit Content:
By changing display to inline-block, the element's width and height
now only expand to fit the content inside,
rather than taking up the full width of the container.
Unlike block elements (which take up the full width of the parent), 
inline-block elements only take up as much space as their content needs.
Before, the h6 might have been a block-level element (the default behavior for headings),
which made it take up the full width of its parent container, 
regardless of how much text was inside.

2. Effect of Padding on Size:
The padding (9px 8px 6px 8px) you've added affects the size of the 
element by adding space inside the element. However, 
since the element is now inline-block, this padding doesnâ€™t make 
the element grow significantly 
it's confined to the size of the text content plus the padding.
